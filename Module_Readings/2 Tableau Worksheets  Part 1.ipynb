    "Drag and Drop\n",
    "In Tableau, you'll need to drag and drop the measures or dimensions into the worksheet. While you may have needed to write code in other analytic platforms, this is not required in Tableau. You simply just drag the data you want into the workspace, and then make sure it's represented correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filters\n",
    "There are many ways to filter your data in Tableau. The following image shows the section for Tableau filters. To filter by a specific dimension, measure, or data field, you can drag it to the filters section. There are other ways to filter as well, but we'll discuss those later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marks\n",

    "\n",
    "Tooltip\n",

    "\n",
    "You can change most of the fonts and styles for the tooltip as well as add data. To edit the tooltip, go to the worksheet you are viewing and then click the tooltip icon in the Marks section, as shown in the following image.\n",

    "\n",
    "Discrete measures are treated as finite values, since there is a countable amount of a given measure. The discrete measures, which are labeled in blue, add headers to the worksheet. An example of a discrete measure is the total number of rides.\n",

    "\n",

    "At times you will need to rename the worksheets to accurately describe your project. To do this, you have two choices. First, you can double-click on the tab and then edit the name of the tab. The second option is to right-click on the tab and then change the name. You can choose either method—there is no right or wrong way.\n",

While you don't need to know everything about designing worksheets, you should be familiar with some best practices.

You can also find plenty of articles and resources on the Tableau website (Links to an external site.) to help you design better worksheets.\n",
