For example, if one map seems to have more popular locations, we may need to look more closely at how many bikes are stationed in those areas and whether there are enough of them. Let's review how dashboards will help us accomplish these kinds of tasks."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Let's rename the dashboard to reflect what we'll be using it for. (Remember, you can rename your dashboard at any time depending on how it changes.) For now we'll call it \"NYC Citi Bike.\" Rename it following the same steps you used to change the titles of worksheets.\n",

    "Designing the Dashboard\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When designing a dashboard, it's important to prioritize which worksheets go on the dashboard first. Generally, the first worksheet will be the most prominent and show the most informative data, so be sure to get the data you care the most about on the page first.\n",

    "Purpose and Audience\n",
    "It's important to understand who your audience is when creating a dashboard in order to ensure the data is relevant to them. For example, an executive may be more interested in the specific locations where bikes will be stored, while a developer may want to know specific data about the site, like the location, number of people using it, and more.\n",

    "Filtering\n",
    "Filtering plays a big role in operability of your dashboard. You can use filters to display certain subsets of data.\n",

    "Highlighting\n",
    "The highlighting feature allows you to select subsets of data. To highlight, drag your mouse over a data subset, which will essentially filter out everything but the data you selected. For example, take a look at the August Peak Hours worksheet:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to find the number of rides from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. To do this, click the 6:00 a.m. bar and then drag to the 10:00 a.m. bar, as shown in the following image:\n",

You can add both of these items to your dashboard using the objects, which is shown in the following image:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can drag these objects into your dashboard. You should be aware of two types of objects: tiled objects and floating objects. Tiled objects are essentially a structured way to arrange your dashboard. Floating objects allow you to change the size of the object and can overlap with other objects. Try both now to see the differences."
