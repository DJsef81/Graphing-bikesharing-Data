# Bikesharing

## Proposal 

During a recent trip to New York City, my friend Kate and I spent two weeks exploring all of the great landmarks and sites that the city had to offer. While on our flight home, we had time to reflect on all the beautiful sites and wonderful locals we met, and and had the realization we were able to do so in large part due to Citibike, a bike sharing business that allows customers to rent and return bicycles from stalls located throughout the city. 

After having this realization, we thought to ourselves that a similar bike sharing business would be very successful in our own hometown of Des Moines, Iowa. 

We are here now to show you, our potential investors, through our analysis below, why a bike share program would be a welcome and successful venture. Our analysis was created using data we analyzed from Citibike from the month of August of 2019 in NYC and other credible online sources that are cited below as well.    

## Overview of Des Moines, Iowa

* Population: 215,636 According to the US Census Bureau 

* 13.7 Million visitors generated $838 Million in spending in 2016 according to research by Longwoods International, commissioned   by Catch Des Moines. 

* "The trail system continues to be one of the most popular amenities in the park system. Recent counts indicate users take over 1   million trail trips each year. With 63 miles of paved and 18 miles of soft trails, there is something and some way for everyone   to get out and be active - from mountain bikers to runners and walkers of all ages. Trails are not just for exercise; numerous     riders utilize trails for their daily commute, year-round. The network in Des Moines serves as a nucleus for the state, with       connectivity to over 550 miles in Central Iowa." - City of Des Moines Website.


## Population of NYC as of 2019

* 8.419 million (2019) population of NYC (2019) 

## Purpose of Analysis

Using Tableau, a data visualization software; we are able to show through graphs 

* The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
